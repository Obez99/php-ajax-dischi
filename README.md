# PHP Ajax Dischi

## Setup
I suggest to open a local server using **MAMP** to open ```index.php```.

**NOTE**: **If the server can't find the api, make sure to edit your file path in the axios call in 'main.js'**

## Description 
This is an alternative version of [the other Spotify I made in Vue CLI](https://github.com/Obez99/vue-dischi), but made to understand how data is passed from backend using PHP and axios.<br>
The ```cds.php``` file returns a JSON containing data of various music albums.<br>
Vue makes an API call to that file and prints the albums in the page.
